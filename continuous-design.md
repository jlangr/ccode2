# Continuous Design

Product owners (and others responsible for helping define a software product) determine the set of end goals that a system must accomplish for its users. Developers in turn build support for each of these goals in the system, in the form of code and configuration. As Jack W. Reeves taught us over three decades ago, this code (and configuration[^fn-config]) is the ultimate and definitive representation of "the design."  [REFERENCE here]

[^fn-config]: Configuration, which can of course be in the form of code itself, is usually also a critical piece of the design, but let's make it simpler by talking only about code here on out.

The word *design* classically has two primary meanings:

* The plan for building something.
* The form and functionality exuded by the current state of that something.

Continuous Design, also abbreviated as... Wait, that abbreviation is already taken. Oh well; we'll refer to it as continuous design, and ultimately just "design"&mdash;because this is how we build systems.

As we were saying: Continuous design means that we are continually planning how to accommodate new features. Most of that planning occurs just as we're writing the code that actually provides the new behaviors. Adding the new code, or updating the existing code, always changes the design, often only in a very small way.

Design is not a nebulous phase of development that occurs at the outset of a project. It is not solely the activity of drawing high-level sketches about what the system needs to look like.

Design is a continuous activity. Our system's design should command our constant attention, because it changes continuously, by definition. Sounds daunting, but in reality it's easier than the alternative of ignoring it.

## Continuous Change

Software is made of code, but maybe it's more useful to say that software is made of thousands of small *behaviors* (sometimes called *units*), each implemented in the form of code. These behaviors interact in a way that supports meeting the end goals of a system's users.

As developers, our job is to translate end goals into a number of smaller software behaviors. Given the goal "present a random list of flashcards for learning Czech nouns," we might implement the following sequence of behaviors:

* retrieve a random subset of all nouns
* for each noun:
  * present a question: a fill-in-the-blank sentence along with a multiple choice listing of the four possible noun forms
  * capture the user's choice
  * show the user the correct answer if their choice is incorrect
* repeat the prior three steps for each question that the user chose incorrectly

There are usually many ways to skin a cat, so we might instead support an alternate set of steps. For example, the user might be able to continue selecting an answer for a single question until they get it correct. We might present hints with each failed answer. We might replace multiple choice questions with fill-in-the blank questions as the user improves in skill.

If there are many design choices for an application itself, there are orders of magnitude more choices for how we write the underlying code. No, that's not right. We have infinite design choices. Most of those choices will be suboptimal.

The job of our product folks is to keep shaping the product to meet the perceived needs of its marketplace of users. Most software product continues to demand constant change in the form of new needs and variants on or enhancements to existing needs.

In turn, we must constantly be able to meet the demand by shaping and enhancing existing software. Code is reasonably unique: It must not only continuously present a design that demonstrates all current needs to date, but it must also accept that this design will need to be different tomorrow.

We might be able to build a slick, useful flashcard system in a short period of time, perhaps a month or two. After an initial release, users will demand new behaviors. We're selling new features, great! But we must also continuously return to the current system's inherent design&mdash;its codebase&mdash. In order to add new features, we're forced to figure out how to accommodate new concepts into the existing design, things that might have never been considered before.

## Continuous Design

When it comes to making choices in software, we have only a few kinds of primary building blocks: modules (classes), functions (methods), data references (variables), and statements/expressions. The first three of these materials can be named, thus giving us humans a better chance of understanding where and what things are in the codebase.

How we choose to manage and organize these building materials when coding behaviors is software design. *Our system's design is the collection of choices we've made to this point in time.*

It is easily possible to make many bad choices when assembling these building materials, and in a very short matter of time to boot. Our flashcard app might still work, but at what cost to future change?

If our flashcard app's code is convoluted, poorly organized, with opaque names for its elements, accommodating new needs will be slow. We'll expend too much time navigating code to find all the places it must change. Once we find those locations (usually plural), we'll expend too much time understanding what the current code does. We'll then expend too much time carefully inserting our changes and ensuring that all the existing behaviors remain unbroken.

Each design choice we make impacts the cost for future choices. We succeed only if we consider the design impact of each choice. This is the critical concept known as continuous design.

## Sailing on the Four C's of Continuous Design

An Unclean CodeÂ© system makes it harder to:

* find code you're looking for
* understand where you need to make changes
* make changes without creating defects
* write tests to verify its behaviors

You might recognize these characteristics from the Class Classes chapter.

We have many design perspectives to help guide us toward a Clean Code system. As we change our system, we continue to reflect on one or more of these perspectives&mdash;SOLID, code smells, simple design, design patterns, and others, including various one-off principles such as the law of Demeter or Tell-Don't-Ask.

We'll try, as many before, to codify it all in a simple, hopefully memorable set of rules. Consider this YADP&mdash;Yet Another Design Perspective.

Our four C's design considerations are:

* Clarity: The programmer's intents in the system are all clearly stated.
* Concision: The programmer's intents in the system are implemented in a minimal amount of code.
* Cohesiveness: Each module in the system has a high level of cohesion&mdash;all its elements maximally relate to one another.
* Confirmability: All unit behaviors in the system can be easily tested, in a way that also provides "living documentation" of the behavioral choices that were made.

These considerations don't live in isolation. We'll talk about each; note how they can both support and opposie each other as we discuss.

# Clarity

Getting code working is always our first step. We're challenged to add a small new piece of behavior to the code. We think about how we want to solve the problem for a small amount of time, then quickly splash some code into our editor. We whittle the code a bit until we finally manage to get it working, then move on to the next slice of logic needed.

If we never had to read that code again, we might consider ourselves "done." Code complete, it ain't broke, and so we ain't gonna try 'n fix what's already working. Why risk breaking things?

The reality, however, is that we *will* have to read that code again when we're later required to change nuances of the logic. Or when we're asked "what does that code do in *this* case?" Or when we're required to add new behaviors that belong in the same module. Or in a half hour when we have to return to the code because it's not quite done yet.

For each of these needs, we want the code to be as clearly stated as possible. Anything unclear becomes a time suck.

It might take you a half-minute or two to decipher all the nuances of the `retrieveWords` function:

```
export const retrieveWords = async words => {
  const wordPrefix = words.length === 1 ? 'word' : 'words'
  let wordList = "";
  for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
    const currentWord = words[i];
    const quotedWord = '"' + currentWord + '"';
    wordList += quotedWord;
    if (i !== words.length - 1) {
      wordList += ",";
    }
  }
  const finalPrompt = `Given a list of English nouns, separated by commas, ` +
    `provide appropriate Czech language information for the ${wordPrefix} ${wordList}`
  const response = await sendPrompt(`${format} ${finalPrompt}`)
  const startIndex = response.indexOf('[')
  const endIndex = response.lastIndexOf(']') + 1
  const jsonText = response.slice(startIndex, endIndex)
  return JSON.parse(jsonText)
}
```

This is not "bad" code, but it could easily be better.

A continual focus on code clarity tells us to produce code that we can all consume quickly:

```
const sliceJSONArrayFrom = response => {
  const startIndex = response.indexOf('[')
  const endIndex = response.lastIndexOf(']') + 1
  return response.slice(startIndex, endIndex)
}

const joinQuoted = words =>
  words.map(word => `"${word}"`).join(',')

const pluralizeIfMany = (word, list) =>
  list.length === 1 ? word : `${word}s`

export const retrieveWords = async words => {
  const finalPrompt = `Given a list of English nouns, separated by commas, ` +
    `provide appropriate Czech language information for the ` +
    `${(pluralizeIfMany('word', words))} ${(joinQuoted(words))}`

  const response = await sendPrompt(`${format} ${finalPrompt}`)

  return JSON.parse(sliceJSONArrayFrom(response))
}
```

If we're tasked with making changes to `retrieveWords`, understanding its overall intent and flow occurs quickly. The function initializes a `finalPrompt` as a long text string with a couple embedded elements:
* either the text "word" or "words," depending on the size of the `words` array
* a joined string of the quoted words in that array.

We then send a larger prompt string to an LLM, receiving a text response. Finally, we slice out the JSON text from the response string (which exists because we sent the LLM a desired format as part of the prompt), then parse it.

We can understand such a function in about 15 seconds; it is largely a statement of policy. It uses extracted functions with names that capture their intent. Each extracted function is implemented in one to three lines of code. If we needn't change any of those implementations, that's one to three lines of hidden detail we can ignore for now and maybe forever. If we do need to change a function, the streamlined policy declaration allows us to find it quickly, focus on a tiny bit of implementation detail, and get out without considering or changing any other code.

## Editing Our Code

Crafting code with high clarity demonstrates that we care enough about our teammates (and ourselves) to spend a few moments editing our code before moving on.

As developers, we're good about getting things to work&mdash;our #1 job. We need to also remind ourselves that we're writers as well, and that others must consume what we write. Once we get our ideas onto paper, good writing demands that we revisit our spewage, and edit it to emphasize clarity.

The sad fact is that we're *not* typically taught to edit our code. The vast majority of code out there shows it, and wastes copious amounts of your time as a result. [reference BOB's COMMENT ABOUT WTF's] "WTF is this code doing?"

In fact, we're often told expressly *not* to edit code. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." There's that lame, misleading mantra again. If other people can't make quick sense of your code, it *is* broken. If you picked up a poorly-written book, one that required you to re-read sentences and paragraphs, you'd consider it a bad, broken book (we bet you had at least one of these at university).

The mantra exists because we fear breaking things. Yes, code is a brittle material. It's pretty easy to make a dumb coding mistake in just about any programming language and not even spot it. As a result, we're inclined to avoid cleaning things up, despite how easy it usually is.

Fearing making changes to our code is a quality smell. There are simple paths to creating the controls needed to know, with every tiny change, whether or not we've broken already-working logic. Visit [REF] on test-driven development to learn how.

## Quick Steps to Clarity

* Extract implementation detail from multipurpose functions into new functions with concise names
* Move functions as appropriate to other modules. This results in increased cohesion, which helps readers find code where they might expect it. 
* Replace comments with clear declarations.
* Write tests that double as documentation on all behavioral intents coded into the system.

## Objections to Clarity

Seasoned programmers are able to immediately digest short code phrases. An experienced JavaScript developer can quickly comprehend the following couple of examples:

```
words.map(word => `"${word}"`).join(',')
```

```
list.length === 1 ? word : `${word}s`
```

Such phrases still demand careful reading; we must mentally assemble the tokens involved into the behavioral concept they represent. A small potential for misinterpretation exists, as does a small potential for a defect. The following line of seemingly-idiomatic code should cause us pause:

```
for (let i = 0; i <= words.length; i++) {
```

... yet for many, it does not. That's not the idiom; this is:

```
for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
```

The first `for` loop is likely a defect.

In any case, extracting small implementation details into intention-revealing functions streamlines code in `retrieveWords`:

```
const joinQuoted = words =>
  words.map(word => `"${word}"`).join(',')

const pluralizeIfMany = (word, list) =>
  list.length === 1 ? word : `${word}s`
  
export const retrieveWords = async words => {
  const finalPrompt = `Given a list of English nouns, separated by commas, ` +
    `provide appropriate Czech language information for the ` +
    `${(pluralizeIfMany('word', words))} ${(joinQuoted(words))}`
    // ...
```

## Declare Intent, Don't Ooze Details

We use functional pipelines partly because they allow us to replace details with declarations:

```
words.map(word => `"${word}"`).join(',')
```

That's loads easier to follow than the old-school procedural equivalent:

```
let wordList = "";
for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
  const currentWord = words[i];
  const quotedWord = '"' + currentWord + '"';
  wordList += quotedWord;
  if (i !== words.length - 1) {
    wordList += ",";
  }
}
```

The old school code has a dramatically increased possibility of hiding defects (hearken back to the `for` loop example).

## Keeping Pipelines Streamlined

While it's reasonable to code short in-line functions within a pipeline:

```
const mostExpensiveHighlyRatedBookInEachCategory = (books) => {
  const result = books.flatMap(category => {
    return category.books
      .filter(book => book.rating > 4.0)
      .sort((a, b) => b.price - a.price)
      .find(() => true)
      .map(book => ({ category: category.category, title: book.title }));
  }).filter(result => result.title !== null);
  return result
}
```
... they break the flow, and require careful stepwise reading. Replacing even the small inline functions with predicates does wonders for the ability to quickly follow the entire flow:

```
const mostExpensiveHighlyRatedBookInEachCategory = (books) => {
  const byPrice = (a, b) => b.price - a.price
  const highlyRated = book => book.rating > 4.0
  const hasTitle = book => book.title !== null
  const categoryAndTitle = (book) =>
    ({ category: category.category, title: book.title })

  return books.flatMap(category => {
    return category.books
      .filter(highlyRated)
      .sort(byPrice)
      .map(categoryAndTitle)
      .slice(0, 1)
  })
    .filter(hasTitle)
}
```

Hmm. The updated solution contains an idiomatic expression: `.slice(0, 1)` returns the first element of an array (less idiomatic) or an empty array if the array is empty (yes idiomatic). We don't eliminate our idioms unless they're causing readers to come to a grinding halt. If so, we find a way to abstract them. (Here, we might create a `firstOrDefault` function to supplant the `slice` call.)

Note that as we extract functions, we find misplaced logic. Typical. A couple functions here might find more appropriate homes in a `book` module. [REF cohesion]

# Conciseness

A functional pipeline can provide code that is not only very clear, but also *concise*. Concise code requires the fewest possible tokens. Code that is maximally concise without consideration for clarity is *obfuscated*. The only legitimate time when we might deliberately obscure code is as part of a post-development deployment process (perhaps for compression or security interests), or as challenge/entertainment (see: https://www.ioccc.org).

The absolute need for clarity means we must find a balance between conciseness and clarity. Finding the balance isn't tough, though: Lean on your teammates. They'll let you know the moment something doesn't make sense. Watch them read through your code, and it'll usually be obvious when they're struggling with your ultra-optimized-logic.

Let's start with an opposite examples however&mdash;code that's clear but not concise. The following `generateCard` function, along with a couple helper functions, assembles a text-based flashcard (complete with the answer on it, hm?).

```
// This function generates a random integer from 0 to n-1
export const randomInt = n => {
    const randomValue = Math.random(); // Generate a random decimal
    const scaledValue = randomValue * n; // Scale the decimal to the desired range
    const flooredValue = Math.floor(scaledValue); // Floor the value to get an integer
    return flooredValue;
}

// This function returns a word in its plural form if needed
const pluralizeIf = (word, isPlural) => {
    if (isPlural) {
        return `${word}s`; // Append 's' to make the word plural
    } else {
        return word; // Return the original word if not plural
    }
}

// This function generates a prompt text for a language card game
const generateCard = (adjectives, nouns) => {
    // Select a random adjective and noun from the provided lists
    const randomAdjectiveIndex = randomInt(adjectives.length);
    const randomNounIndex = randomInt(nouns.length);
    const adjective = adjectives[randomAdjectiveIndex];
    const noun = nouns[randomNounIndex];

    // Determine the case and number randomly
    const nominativeOrAccusative = randomInt(2) === 0 ? 'nominative' : 'accusative';
    const isPlural = randomInt(2) === 0;
    const singularOrPlural = isPlural ? 'plural' : 'singular';

    // Get the correct forms of the noun and adjective based on case and number
    const correctNoun = noun[singularOrPlural][nominativeOrAccusative];
    const nounGender = noun.gender.toLowerCase();
    const correctAdjective = adjective[nominativeOrAccusative][singularOrPlural][nounGender];

    // Construct the prompt text for the game card
    const promptText = `Adjective: ${adjective.word}
Noun: ${noun.word}

Determine the ${singularOrPlural} ${nominativeOrAccusative} case.

Correct answer: ${correctAdjective} ${correctNoun}`;

    // Return the constructed prompt
    return promptText;
}
```

The code appears typical to us. The core function, `generateCard`, is a top-to-bottom affair. It's not terribly long, but includes comments to guide readers through what's happening in the next few statements. Each of the function's statements uses clear variable names and is readily comprehensible. We can carefully read through the code statement-by-statement, mentally assembling groups of statements into unit behaviors. What's not to like?

Indeed, the above example is how many developers happily continue coding for most of their career. But it's suboptimal for numerous reasons.

A reworked version results in additional small helper functions:

```
export const randomInt = n => Math.floor(Math.random() * n)

const pluralizeIf = (word, isPlural) => isPlural ? `${word}s` : word

const randomElement = (array) => array[randomInt(array.length)]

const cases = ["nominative", "accusative"]
const numbers = ["singular", "plural"]

const generateRandomCardData = (adjectives, nouns) => ({
  adjective: randomElement(adjectives),
  noun: randomElement(nouns),
  grammaticalCase: randomElement(cases),
  number: randomElement(numbers)
})

const formatCard = (adjective, noun, number, grammaticalCase, correctAdjective, correctNoun) =>
  `${adjective.word} ${pluralizeIf(noun.word, number === 'plural')}
  
  Provide the ${number} ${grammaticalCase} case.
  
  Correct answer: ${correctAdjective} ${correctNoun}
`

const generateCard = (adjectives, nouns) => {
  const { adjective, noun, grammaticalCase, number } = generateRandomCardData(adjectives, nouns)

  const correctNoun = noun[number][grammaticalCase]
  const correctAdjective = adjective[grammaticalCase][number][noun.gender.toLowerCase()]

  return formatCard(adjective, noun, number, grammaticalCase, correctAdjective, correctNoun)
}
```

Clarity is increased in a few ways. Distilling `generateCard` into three top-level chunks allows readers to quickly identify the overall policy: 
* Generate random flash card elements using the adjectives and nouns passed in
* Determine the correct answers to the challenge on the flash card by dereferencing the noun and adjective structures passed in
* Return a formatted card containing all the relevant information

We can immediately understand and trust each supporting function or piece of data in this solution. It's also likely that we don't even need to looked at most of the code most of the time. The separate functions enhance clarity by allowing us to focus on small, understandable chunks. And while it would help to see the data structures involved (individual `noun` and `adjective` objects specifically), every statement otherwise stands on its own. No statements demand a comment. Comments would only increase the development, comprehension, and maintenance costs for this code.

As for understanding the data structures, that's what unit tests are for, albeit we might make a case for extracting a couple functions to get just an ounce more isolation from implementation specifics in `generateCard`: [REF]

```
const generateCard = (adjectives, nouns) => {
  const { adjective, noun, grammaticalCase, number } = generateRandomCardData(adjectives, nouns)

  const correctNoun = selectNoun(noun, number, grammaticalCase)
  const correctAdjective = selectAdjective(adjective, grammaticalCase, number, noun)

  return formatCard(adjective, noun, number, grammaticalCase, correctAdjective, correctNoun)
}
```

We also spotted opportunities to emphasize cohesive elements, by introducing a new abstraction&mdash;the notion of an object that captures the underlying data elements of a random card. Yet there's still something amiss with our function&mdash;the excessive number of parameters returned and passed about not only muddles the function, but also decreases its concision.

Let's make a final cleanup pass.

```
const generateRandom = (adjectives, nouns) => ({
  adjective: randomElement(adjectives),
  noun: randomElement(nouns),
})

const formatCard = (phrase, caseAgreement, correctAdjective, correctNoun) =>
  `${phrase.adjective.word} ${pluralizeIf(phrase.noun.word, caseAgreement.number === 'plural')}
  
  Provide the ${caseAgreement.number} ${caseAgreement.grammaticalCase} case.
  
  Correct answer: ${correctAdjective} ${correctNoun}
`

const selectNoun = (noun, caseAgreement) =>
  noun[caseAgreement.number][caseAgreement.grammaticalCase]

const selectAdjective = (adjective, gender, caseAgreement) =>
  adjective[caseAgreement.grammaticalCase][caseAgreement.number][gender.toLowerCase()]

const cases = ["nominative", "accusative"]
const numbers = ["singular", "plural"]

const generateCaseAgreementChallenge = () => ({
  grammaticalCase: randomElement(cases),
  number: randomElement(numbers)
})

const generateCard = (adjectives, nouns) => {
  const phrase = generateRandom(adjectives, nouns)
  const caseAgreement = generateCaseAgreementChallenge()

  const correctAdjective = selectAdjective(phrase.adjective, phrase.noun.gender, caseAgreement)
  const correctNoun = selectNoun(phrase.noun, caseAgreement)

  return formatCard(phrase, caseAgreement, correctAdjective, correctNoun)
}
```

Slightly more-thoughtful data groupings make `generateCard` seem less of a haphazard bustle of wayward local variables. Each of its handful of steps emphasizes the key elements involved. We also reworked `selectAdjective` to accommodate a gender parameter instead of a noun. Our choice emphasizes that a noun's gender, specifically, is key to determining the proper adjective.

## Code Duplication

Being concise in code means implementing concepts once and only once. We often find small chunks of implementation detail replicated through a module or codebase&mdash;usually from a couple to handful of lines that are oft repeated.

```
export const postItem = (request, response) => {
  const itemDetails = retrieveItem(request.body.upc)
  if (!itemDetails) {
    response.status = 400
    const errorMessage = 'unrecognized UPC code';
    logError(errorMessage)
    return response.send({error: errorMessage})
  }

  const checkout = Checkouts.retrieve(request.params.id)
  if (!checkout) {
    response.status = 400
    const errorMessage = 'nonexistent checkout';
    logError(errorMessage)
    return response.send({error: errorMessage})
  }

  const newCheckoutItem = Checkouts.addItem(checkout, itemDetails)

  sendResponse(response, newCheckoutItem, 201)
}
```

Repetition increases costs for a number of reasons. The essence of the controller function `postItem` is obscured by repetitious error handling code. This duplication also decreases clarity, by mixing implementation details into policy flow.

```
const sendRequestError = (response, message) => {
  response.status = 400
  logError(errorMessage)
  response.send({error: message})
}

export const postItem = (request, response) => {
  const itemDetails = retrieveItem(request.body.upc)
  if (!itemDetails)
    return sendRequestError(response, 'unrecognized UPC code')

  const checkout = Checkouts.retrieve(request.params.id)
  if (!checkout)
    return sendRequestError(response, 'nonexistent checkout')

  const newCheckoutItem = Checkouts.addItem(checkout, itemDetails)

  sendResponse(response, newCheckoutItem, 201)
}
```

Often, eliminating duplication involves replacing concrete details with abstractions. It's generally a win-win-win-win situation (increased conciseness, clarity, ease of confirmability, and a springboard to increased cohesion), but we don't go overboard by obsessing over two lines of code that happen to look the same. We seek to find and eradicate duplicate implementations of concepts, not incidentally common lines of code.

Duplication fosters many increases in cost/effort:

* Time to read and comprehend cost
* Time to search code in general (we're always wading through increased amounts of irrelevant results)
* Time to test
* Effort to find all points of change for a replicated concept
* Risk of not finding all necessary points of change
* Time to analyze whether variances found in duplicated code are deliberate or if they represent defects
* Effort to change duplicated code
* Cost to refactor code
* Propagation of defect costs, when common code is defective

We've worked on many systems that were two-to-three times as large as they might have been due to rampant code duplication. Oh, the days of getting paid by the line of code! (Just kidding. It never happened for any of us.)

One example included an operating room scheduling system, which by definition needed to do a lot of work with dates and timestamps. Among many other amusements, we found a common five-line piece of (old school) Java date handling logic. These five lines were repeated in over fifty places throughout the code. Add to our list of costs a dramatic increase in effort to replace one library with another.

Extract-and-move is once again our trustworthy workhorse for tackling duplication problems:

* Identify a clump of implementation detail that represents a singular concept
* Extract it to a function.
* Inspect and move to another module if appropriate.

As awareness of that new module increases, we start to spot and eliminate more opportunities for its common use.

## Conciseness Nits

Every unnecessary token adds to the clutter of our code. We *can* and should often use things like idiomatic constructs and syntactic sugar to reduce the amount of unnecessary code that we must scan. A few pet nits of ours:

#### Return Boolean Expressions

Learning a language well not only means we learn its syntax, but that we also learn the most concise way of representing common concepts. Some of these streamlined constructs might go as far as to be classified as *idiomatic*. (Yes we've used that word a number of times; we guess we should finally define it: Idiomatic code isn't obvious the first time you see it.)

A ternary operator isn't idiomatic: In an isolated context, it doesn't inherently provide all the information you need to decipher it. The second or third time you see it, however, you'll know how to interpret it&mdash;it has become obvious to you. It's like riding a bicycle; you won't likely ever need to be reminded after that.

Sometimes we see anti-idioms:

```
const hasTitle = book => {
  if (book.title !== null) {
    return true
  } else {
    return false
  }
}
```

Anti-idiom? Despite the fact that this construct demands **five precious vertical source lines**, we usually digest it as a single chunk when we see it (because unfortunately we see it a lot). Sometimes we even notice when some chucklehead has sneakily reversed the order of the `true` and `false` returns.

We rarely say that things are flat-out wrong in programming, but this is one of those cases.

Simply (and we don't use that word lightly) return the boolean expression:

```
const hasTitle = book => book.title !== null
```

### Unnecessary Else

Maybe we needn't embrace the ternary operator&mdash;worse things than `if-else` statements pollute our coding world&mdash;but if we're going to code a conditional `return`:

```
const pluralizeIf = (word, isPlural) => {
  if (isPlural) {
      return `${word}s`
  } else {
      return word
  }
}
```

... we should at least have the decency to not include the unnecessary `else` keyword. An early `return` suffices:

```
const pluralizeIf = (word, isPlural) => {
  if (isPlural) {
    return `${word}s`;
  }
  return word
}
```

No, we really don't need the braces, though odds are good our team has adopted a coding standard that insists on them. But it's really just overprotective clutter. It's hard to mess up if you start with a short single-line `if` statement:

```
const pluralizeIf = (word, isPlural) => {
  if (isPlural) return `${word}s`
  return word
}
```

We write tests if we remain worried.

In any case, there's honestly not much good reason to eschew a ternary for this example:

```
const pluralizeIf = (word, isPlural) => isPlural ? `${word}s` : word
```

We get it, though, if you object on aesthetic grounds.

### And So On

We could dedicate an entire book to clutter in code. Most of it, however, you'll figure out on our own. We don't seek *clever* code; we instead seek *elegant* code. Elegant code says exactly what it needs, without too few or too many words. It is both clear and concise.

# Confirmability

Our continuous design journey requires that we know what our code is intended to do. Without that knowledge, any change is unsafe. A system may contain many thousands of behavioral units. An unnoticed change in behavior to any one of them can allow us to unleash a costly defect in production.

Fortunately, we can write thousands of small unit tests that verify whether we've created any regressions. These tests can tell us within seconds the moment we broke something. We'll need other kinds of tests at higher levels, of course, such as end-to-end functional tests, performance tests, load tests, and contract tests. But if we want to move fast, we need to be able to rapidly create and manage tests around the unit implementations.

### Fear Degrades Design

In contrast, the lack of such tests gradually slows us down. As the amount of (not unit tested) code increases, our costs to verify it increase. We can only manually step through so many test cases. We can write integration tests, but they're generally costlier to build and maintain. They also create a slower feedback loop. Finally, it's unrealistic to expect that you'll be able to cover all the thousands of intentional decisions and logic variants that went into the codebase.

Without fast feedback in the form of unit tests, we relegate ourselves to that "it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality. Our codebase degrades by definition. We don't have the confidence to ensure the code remains cohesive, clear, and concise. Instead, we habitually slap out "first drafts": We get our code working, then immediately move onto the next thing without making any edits.

It seems fast at first, yet the results of fear-driven coding quickly become apparent in the codebase. Developers learn to do the worst possible thing to a system, rather than what they know to be the best thing for the system.

A real example from a high-performance, historically-famous large system: Developers needed to create variants of behaviors existing within typically long (100+ line) C++ member functions. Shipping defective versions of these existing behaviors could cost the company millions of dollars per minute. 

As a result, developers habitually *replicated* (i.e. copy 'n' pasted) entire member functions, then made their changes within these copies. They didn't change the original functions&mdash;no one wanted to be the one who broke code that was already working. ("Why did you even touch that code?")

By definition, fear significantly increased code duplication and costs as a result.

## Conflated Units -> Tough Tests

If we write code like the `postCheckoutTotal` function following, writing tests for it will be daunting:

```
export const postCheckoutTotal = (request, response) => {
  const checkoutId = request.params.id
  const checkout = Checkouts.retrieve(checkoutId)
  if (!checkout) {
    response.status = 400
    response.send({error: 'nonexistent checkout'})
    return
  }

  const messages = []
  const discount = checkout.member ? checkout.discount : 0

  let totalOfDiscountedItems = 0
  let total = 0
  let totalSaved = 0

  checkout.items.forEach(item => {
    let price = item.price
    const isExempt = item.exempt
    if (!isExempt && discount > 0) {
      const discountAmount = discount * price
      const discountedPrice = price * (1.0 - discount)

      // add into total
      totalOfDiscountedItems += discountedPrice

      let text = item.description
      // format percent
      const amount = parseFloat((Math.round(price * 100) / 100).toString()).toFixed(2)
      const amountWidth = amount.length

      let textWidth = LineWidth - amountWidth
      messages.push(pad(text, textWidth) + amount)

      total += discountedPrice

      // discount line
      const discountFormatted = '-' + parseFloat((Math.round(discountAmount * 100) / 100).toString()).toFixed(2)
      textWidth = LineWidth - discountFormatted.length
      text = `   ${discount * 100}% mbr disc`
      messages.push(`${pad(text, textWidth)}${discountFormatted}`)

      totalSaved += discountAmount
    }
    else {
      total += price
      const text = item.description
      const amount = parseFloat((Math.round(price * 100) / 100).toString()).toFixed(2)
      const amountWidth = amount.length

      const textWidth = LineWidth - amountWidth
      messages.push(pad(text, textWidth) + amount)
    }
  })

  total = Math.round(total * 100) / 100

  // append total line
  const formattedTotal = parseFloat((Math.round(total * 100) / 100).toString()).toFixed(2)
  const formattedTotalWidth = formattedTotal.length
  const textWidth = LineWidth - formattedTotalWidth
  messages.push(pad('TOTAL', textWidth) + formattedTotal)

  if (totalSaved > 0) {
    const formattedTotal = parseFloat((Math.round(totalSaved * 100) / 100).toString()).toFixed(2)
    console.log(`formattedTotal: ${formattedTotal}`)
    const formattedTotalWidth = formattedTotal.length
    const textWidth = LineWidth - formattedTotalWidth
    messages.push(pad('*** You saved:', textWidth) + formattedTotal)
  }

  totalOfDiscountedItems = Math.round(totalOfDiscountedItems * 100) / 100

  totalSaved = Math.round(totalSaved * 100) / 100

  response.status = 200
  // send total saved instead
  response.send({ id: checkoutId, total, totalOfDiscountedItems, messages, totalSaved })
}
```

Capturing all the nuances and writing tests for all relevant cases might take a few hours. There's a good possibility that we don't cover all the cases, also, which increases our risk of shipping defects.

## Small, Isolated Units -> Simple Tests

Much easier is to write small, simple tests as we craft the logic for assembling a checkout receipt. No doubt you can spot a few of the bits of duplication in the midst of `postCheckoutTotal`, as well as the number of opportunities for extracting conceptual units to new functions.

Here's an improved solution, a work in progress.

```
const sendSuccessResponse = (response, body) => {
  response.status = 200
  response.send(body)
}

const sendErrorResponse = (response, message) => {
  response.status = 400
  response.send({ error: message })
}

export const postCheckoutTotal = (request, response) => {
  const checkoutId = request.params.id
  const checkout = Checkouts.retrieve(checkoutId)
  if (!checkout) return sendErrorResponse(response, 'nonexistent checkout')

  const { totals, messages } = createReceipt(checkout)

  sendSuccessResponse(response, {
    id: checkoutId,
    messages,
    total: round2(totals.total),
    totalOfDiscountedItems: round2(totals.totalOfDiscountedItems),
    totalSaved: round2(totals.totalSaved)
  })
}
```

The function `postCheckoutTotal`, now a declaration of policy, can be covered with a couple "end-to-end" tests.

The module `receipt.js` exposes code that can be directly and easily unit-tested:

```
import { pad } from '../../util/stringutil'
import { calculateTotal, calculateTotalOfDiscountedItems, calculateTotalSaved } from './checkout-model'

const LineWidth = 45
const Indent = `   `

export const round2 = amount => Math.round(amount * 100) / 100

const formatAmount = amount => parseFloat(round2(amount)).toFixed(2)

const shouldApplyDiscount = (checkout, item) => !item.exempt && memberDiscountPct(checkout) > 0

const calculateDiscountAmount = (checkout, item) => memberDiscountPct(checkout) * item.price

const memberDiscountPct = checkout => checkout.member ? checkout.discount : 0

const lineItem = (text, lineAmount) => {
  const amount = formatAmount(lineAmount)
  const amountWidth = amount.length
  const textWidth = LineWidth - amountWidth
  return pad(text, textWidth) + amount
}

export const createReceiptMessages = (checkout, totals) => {
  const messages = []
  checkout.items.forEach(item => {
    messages.push(lineItem(item.description, item.price))
    if (shouldApplyDiscount(checkout, item)) {
      messages.push(lineItem(
        `${Indent}${memberDiscountPct(checkout) * 100}% mbr disc`,
        -calculateDiscountAmount(checkout, item)))
    }
  })
  messages.push(lineItem('TOTAL', round2(totals.total)))
  if (totals.totalSaved > 0)
    messages.push(lineItem('*** You saved:', totals.totalSaved))
  return messages
}

export const createReceipt = checkout => {
  const totals = ({
    total: calculateTotal(checkout),
    totalSaved: calculateTotalSaved(checkout),
    totalOfDiscountedItems: calculateTotalOfDiscountedItems(checkout)
  })
  return {
    totals,
    messages: createReceiptMessages(checkout, totals)
  }
}
```

By separating out `receipt.js`, we've also increased cohesion. The `postCheckoutTotal` function is primarily concerned with orchestrating the creation of a response to a request. It delegates the calculation specifics of assembling a receipt and totals to the `receipt.js` module

`receipt.js` still includes a few utility/helper functions that could be again moved, then tested in isolation (notably `round2` and `formatAmount`).

Here's the final cohesive module, `checkout-model.js`:

```
export const calculateTotal = checkout => {
  let total = 0
  checkout.items.forEach(item => {
    if (!item.exempt && (checkout.member ? checkout.discount : 0) > 0)
      total += item.price * (1.0 - (checkout.member ? checkout.discount : 0))
    else
      total += item.price
  })
  return total
}

export const calculateTotalSaved = checkout => {
  let totalSaved = 0
  checkout.items.forEach(item => {
    if (!item.exempt && (checkout.member ? checkout.discount : 0) > 0)
      totalSaved += (checkout.member ? checkout.discount : 0) * item.price
  })
  return totalSaved
}

export const calculateTotalOfDiscountedItems = checkout =>
  checkout.items
    .filter(item => !item.exempt && (checkout.member ? checkout.discount : 0) > 0)
    .reduce((total, item) => total + item.price * (1.0 - (checkout.member ? checkout.discount : 0)), 0)
```

Now isolated, we can focus on improving clarity and conciseness within these `calculate` functions. We can put tests in place in short order. It took ten minutes to create these tests for `calculateTotal`:

```
import {calculateTotal} from "./checkout-model";

describe('calculate total', () => {
  it('is zero when no items exist', () => {
    const checkout = {
      items: []
    }

    const result = calculateTotal(checkout)

    expect(result).toBe(0)
  })

  it('is price of single undiscounted item', () => {
    const checkout = {
      items: [{ price: 42 }]
    }

    const result = calculateTotal(checkout)

    expect(result).toBe(42)
  })

  it('discounts item when member attached to checkout and item not exempt', () => {
    const checkout = {
      member: {},
      discount: 0.1,
      items: [{
        exempt: false,
        price: 100
      }]
    }

    const result = calculateTotal(checkout)

    expect(result).toBe(90)
  })

  it('does not discount item when exempt', () => {
    const checkout = {
      member: {},
      discount: 0.1,
      items: [{
        exempt: true,
        price: 100
      }]
    }

    const result = calculateTotal(checkout)

    expect(result).toBe(100)
  })

  it('does not discount item when no member attached', () => {
    const checkout = {
      discount: 0.1,
      items: [{
        exempt: true,
        price: 100
      }]
    }

    const result = calculateTotal(checkout)

    expect(result).toBe(100)
  })

  it('totals discounted and non-discounted items', () => {
    const checkout = {
      discount: 0.1,
      member: {},
      items: [
        { exempt: true, price: 5 },
        { exempt: true, price: 10 },
        { exempt: false, price: 100 },
        { exempt: false, price: 200 },
      ]
    }

    const result = calculateTotal(checkout)

    expect(result).toBe(5 + 10 + 90 + 180)
  })
})
```

The tests gave us the confidence to fearlessly refactor `calculateTotal` to a clearer solution:

```
const memberDiscountPct = checkout =>
  checkout.member ? checkout.discount : 0

const shouldApplyDiscount = (checkout, item) =>
  !item.exempt && memberDiscountPct(checkout) > 0

const calculateDiscountedPrice = (checkout, item) =>
  item.price * (1.0 - memberDiscountPct(checkout))

export const calculateTotal = checkout => {
  const totalDiscountable = checkout.items
    .filter(item => shouldApplyDiscount(checkout, item))
    .reduce((total, item) => total + calculateDiscountedPrice(checkout, item), 0);
  const totalNonDiscountable = checkout.items
    .filter(item => !shouldApplyDiscount(checkout, item))
    .reduce((total, item) => total + item.price, 0);
  return totalDiscountable + totalNonDiscountable;
}
```

It looks like our refactoring increased the lines of code, for `calculateTotal` at least. However, the overall number of lines in the module decrease by a handful after we made similar changes to the other calculation functions as well.


## Dependencies and Testing

- interest in simpler testing promotes dependency minimization


## Cohesion

It was nearly impossible to get to this last C-criteria for design without involving talk of cohesion. Our continuous design criteria necessarily intertwine to support each other, and at times can be at odds with one another. Increasing clarity might require diminishing conciseness, for example.

But here we are, and cohesion deserves its own focused discussion.

We're building *czecher*, a flashcard application designed to help us ingrain challenging aspects of the Czech language. As a first step, we've created the module `words.js` to allow us to add new nouns to our collection of words to practice:

```
import { retrieveWord } from '../prompts/languageClient.js'

const definitions = {}

export const clearWords = () =>
  Object.keys(definitions).forEach(key => delete definitions[key])

export const loadDefinition = (word, definition) =>
  definitions[word] = { ...definition, word }

export const addWord = async word => {
  if (definitions[word]) return

  const definition = await retrieveWord(word)
  definitions[word] = { ...definition, word }
}

export const definition = word => definitions[word]

export const allDefinitions = () =>
  Object.values(definitions)
```

The `addWord` function takes on an English word as an argument (e.g. "dog"). If a definition has already been loaded for the word, the function does nothing. Otherwise, `addword` calls `retrieveWord` to look up information using a 3rd party resource (OpenAI in this case). The resulting definition is added to a local store. Calling the `definition` function with a word returns the detailed information.

Some tests might add a little color:

```
import { when } from 'jest-when'
import { addWord, clearWords, definition, allDefinitions, loadDefinition } from './words'
import { retrieveWord } from '../prompts/languageClient'

jest.mock('../prompts/languageClient')

describe('addWord', ()  => {
  const orangeDefinition = {
    word: 'orange',
    gender: 'MI',
    singular: { nominative: 'pomeranÄ', accusative: 'pomeranÄ' },
    plural: { nominative: 'pomeranÄe', accusative: 'pomeranÄe' }
  }
  const dogDefinition = {
    word: 'dog',
    gender: 'MA',
    singular: { nominative: 'pes', accusative: 'psa' },
    plural: { nominative: 'psi', accusative: 'psy' }
  }

  beforeEach(() => {
    clearWords()
    jest.resetAllMocks()
  })

  it('retrieves and saves definition on add', async () => {
    when(retrieveWord).calledWith('orange')
      .mockResolvedValueOnce(orangeDefinition)

    await addWord('orange')

    expect(definition('orange')).toEqual(orangeDefinition)
  })

  it('does nothing if already added', async () => {
    loadDefinition('orange', orangeDefinition)

    const word = definition('orange')

    expect(word).toEqual(orangeDefinition)
    expect(retrieveWord).not.toHaveBeenCalled()
  })

  const add = async (word, definition) => {
    when(retrieveWord).calledWith(word).mockResolvedValueOnce(definition)
    await addWord(word)
  }

  it('persists multiple words', async () => {
    await add('orange', orangeDefinition)
    await add('dog', dogDefinition)

    const definitions = allDefinitions()

    expect(definitions).toEqual([orangeDefinition, dogDefinition])
  })
})
```

The `words` module is our first incremental step toward an MVP. As a quick measure, we chose to persist the words in an in-memory JavaScript object (`{}`), where the keys are the words and the values provide the language detail we need. The constant `orangeDefinition` provides one example.

What's our continuous design report card look like? We get the following grades:

* Clarity: pass. All the operations appear in short, JavaScript-idiomatic functions, without any C-for-Cleverness (for which we would immediately get a failing grade).
* Confirmability: pass. All code was driven into existence by behavioral tests.
* Conciseness: pass. The code seems about as short as it could get.
* Cohesion: fail. What??

Our intent is to replace the JavaScript object with a proper persistence mechanism. Unfortunately, we've mired our little bit of definition-management logic with how we intend to store the definitions. When we do change, we'll have to open up the `words` module and poke through most of its methods to update implementations.

You will likely recognize that we're describing a single-responsibility principle (SRP) violation. The both say the same thing, minus some nuances. Cohesion is how well the elements of a module align to the same purpose.

Had we adhered to a cohesive solution, we might have found it a bit easier to build the solution in the first place. We'd also have been ready to immediately accommodate changes, rather than have to pre-factor our code to support the change.

We'll refactor the code now, to demonstrate how a cohesive solution increases the clarity of the code.

```
import { retrieveWord } from '../prompts/languageClient.js'
import * as Data from '../persistence/database.js'

export const clearWords = () =>
  Data.deleteAll()

export const loadDefinition = (word, definition) =>
  Data.add(word, definition)

export const addWord = async word => {
  if (Data.containsKey(word)) return

  const definition = await retrieveWord(word)
  Data.add(word, { word, ...definition})
}

export const definition = word => Data.get(word)

export const allDefinitions = () => Data.allValues()
```

The implementation specifics around JavaScript objects have been replaced with abstractions: `add`, `get`, `allValues`, `containsKey`, and `deleteAll`. The underlying implementation could change from an object, to a list, to interaction with a key-value store. The now-cohesive `words` module wouldn't be impacted by these changes.

The module `database.js` provides an abstract interface for persisting data, with nothing exported that betrays the underlying data structure. Future changes to its implementation don't impact other code in the system.

```
const data = {}

export const containsKey = key => data[key]

export const deleteAll = () =>
  Object.keys(data).forEach(key => delete data[key])

export const add = (key, value) =>
  data[key] = value

export const get = word => data[word]

export const allValues = () => Object.values(data)
```

##  Confirmability

If we have a hard time writing a test, our code is not easily confirmable.

code written first:
- dense
- much intertwining of concerns-- demands large setup of context/data
- hard to piece out all the intents (tests written later)
- private dependencies

Cohesive code: small, single purpose modules easier to write tests for.

Minimize the intertwining of stateful dependencies

Tests: document all the choices
